# 2022 EY Data Science Challenge 1 - Local Frog Discovery Tool
(https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8722155/155844320-675d999b-d413-4cf5-9ff9-857d2637729b.jpg)

In this challenge, we will be developing a Species Distribution Model (SDM) for one Australian frog species using variables from the [TerraClimate](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/terraclimate) dataset. A species distribution model is a specific type of machine learning model that aims to predict the distribution of a biological species across geographic space and time. Such models have become increasingly important in conservation efforts globally to better understand and map the habitats of species of interest, particularly threatened or endangered species.


The [notebook](notebook.ipynb) contains the solution along with explanations step by step.

In order to run, a conda environment is needed with [these requirements](environment.yml).
